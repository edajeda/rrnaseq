v1.3.1
*fixed missing ncores in rseq.heatmap

v1.3.0
*heatmap: now excludes supplied rows not present in data matrix
+sampledist_boxplot: stratification now possible
*API improvement: Read data in bin rather than in lib fcn: sampledist_boxplot
*sample2ngenes: now plots vertical line at cutoff
*pca: now orders the legend-labels

v.1.2.1
*bugfix: mapstats coverage plot

v.1.2.0
+ercc: plotting number of molecules vs RPKM (not only concentration vs RPKM)
+added possibility for aggregating by stratum: expr_dhist, sample2ngenes
*API improvement: Read data in bin rather than in lib fcn: ercc, pca, expr_dhist, sampledist_heatmap
*exp_dhist: improved x-axis tick labelling
*get.meta: bugfixed coverage boxplots

v1.1.3
*bugfix: sub strings only in basename to create output pdfs.

v1.1.2
*bugfix: sampledist.boxplot: sub string "cor" only in basename

v1.1.1
*log10 fixes

v1.1.0
*Parallel version of cor function, bigcor.par
*Changed default color map in sampledist_heatmap -> heat.colors

v1.0.9
*sample2ngenes.expr: API friendly (data-structures instead of files); added option to add n.genes.expr column to meta.mat
*expr.lib.R:add.factor.color: added continuous color option and if the color column already exists it is updated

v1.0.8
*Test suite: rqc: Test heatmap by plotting top genes from Brennecke
*brennecke: Sort genes by gene.var.quants column before dumping stats.mat.tab. Also dump top genes to file.

v1.0.7
+heatmap of columns and rows
*Bugfix: reusing clustering results from cor.res.list: cor.res -> col.cor

v1.0.6
*Bugfix: qc.col never set in pca filtering

v1.0.5
*gene_filter: Added argument for the number of strata in which a gene need to pass the n.samples filter
*var_stats_brennecke: changed naming: all -> nostrat
*gitignored notes.tex and added changelog as a separate file
*Add comment about releases to readme

v1.0.4
*Fix cor.res.list updates such that order of program calls doesnt matter (sampledist_boxplot first or not)
*Add error-check to mapstats, checking if sample names differ between meta.rds and rpkm.rds

v1.0.3
*Bug in updating qc.mat (not resetting the column to zeroes if rerunning and updating qc.mat)

v1.0.2
*Reran test

v1.0.1
*Minor update of README
*Added -f (frac-adjustment) to ercc call in rqc
*Added -e sampledist.cor.res.rds to calls in rqc

v1.0.0
*ercc: filter all data-structures on filtered samples
*read.rpkm: get vector of ERCC ids from all rpkm files instead of only the first file
*gene2nsamples: subset on intersection of meta.mat and rpkm samples
*hclust: increased pdf size
*Updated README (missing getopt package in install instruction)
*Updated .gitignore

v0.1.4
*sampledist.heatmap, sampldist.boxplot, sample.hclust: rm constant columns before correlation calculation, otherwise error is thrown.
*Updated README
*Updated -h info
*rqc: Added several pca calls with different number of pcs to rqc

v0.1.3
*Write qc.tab and not only qc.rds
*pca: Fixed output file-name bug when substituting string 'pca' if two or one PCs.
*sample_heatmap, sample_boxplot, sample_hclust: Added option to save the calculated sample-distance objects (cor.res, col.clust) since for large datasets it takes very long time to calculate.
*mapstats: Work-around for an R bug: Small cex values are silenced using pdf device on OS X. Solution: Increased the pdf size.
*sampledist_boxplot: Changed default of max.cor.cutoff to 0.2.
*get_expr: Add option to set the sample column name in meta.file where sample names will be matched against the rpkmforgenes-file sample names
*get.expr: Add option which reads file-names from a file
*get.meta: Ignore lines with "no data for" (fill = TRUE)
*get.meta: Set sample names for 'no data for' rows output by make_summary_starlog.sh

v0.1.2
*get_expr: stripped '_unique.bam' from sample column names in read.rpkm

v0.1.1
*README updates

v0.1.0
*Tag and "install" the tag on rna (globally)
*Create test dataset
